## #People For People Ⓒ2021

## WEEK10-12 project by Aziz , Tawfeek and Amal

- - In our project we propose an idea called “People For People” in other words people helping people, the idea of our project is to donate with things that we dont need anymmore (clothes,furniture, electircal items,etc…) without any fanancial return (for free).
- - We divided the project into backend and frontend; You are looking into the backend right now.

Backend :

Controllers ??????????
Database
Handlers
Model
server.js
package.json(for starting the server)

Database -->

we insert some data in our database to be displayed on the running server with a possibility to add a new items on the list (database list) includes item-title , item-descriptions , photo, category, location , contact details, availability to be deliver or not.
Connecting the database to the server is made in “build.js” and “connection.js”.

Handlers -->

donationHandler.js

donationsList.js ??????????

searchItem.js : Let you search the items in our database by category,area,delivery.

model -->

donations.js : you can access your donated-items list by your e-mail by submiting yoour email, this will display all the items the you have inserted(delivered,archived,deleted).

server.js -->

Where all the routing tables are based with the server

I wish you donate in our website/application to help more people, may this reflects on you one day, this will be a good deed for you :)
